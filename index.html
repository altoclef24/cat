 <p>The Devon Rex is a medium sized cat with a lean, muscular body. They have short fur, that is often curly or wavy, giving it a rippled effect. They are an active, 
  energetic and extroverted breed. They are known for being affectionate and willing to follow their owners around the house and sit on their loved ones shoulders.</p>
<p>All Devon Rex are descended from a group of non-pedigree cats in Devon, England. A natural mutation occurred among a litter of kittens, giving one of them curly fur. 
   This curly-coated kitten was adopted by Miss Beryl Cox and her friend Miss Margaret Croll from Buckfastleigh, Devon. They named this kitten, Kirlee. Once they became 
   aware of just how rare Kirlee was, They wrote to a breeder who had a curly cat just Kirlee, and Kirlee became well known.</p>
